Dionne Dawson is the founder of Dionne Chicago Dream, a non-profit social enterprise that delivers fresh fruits and vegetables to 4,300 households in the Chicago land region per week. Since 2020, they've provided a little over 3.5 million pounds of fresh produce to the neighborhood and they've never charged any of their recipients today. The average black land nonprofit never makes it to a million revenue in 18 months. Dionne is up to 48 employees and about 15 vehicles were opening up a 20,000 square foot location later this year. Dianne Dawson is a dreamer who believes in the possibility of anything being possible.
