Dion Dawson founded Dionâ€™s Chicago Dream, a non-profit providing consistent access to fresh produce for underserved communities. Since 2020, the organization has delivered over 3.5 million pounds of fruits and vegetables to 4,300 households weekly without charging recipients. Rejecting donations and unpaid labor, they built a sustainable model based on quality, equity, and respect. By 2025, the team grew to 48 employees, 15 vehicles, and a new 20,000 sq ft facility. The initiative began from a spontaneous idea on Juneteenth and has since become a movement grounded in joy, dignity, and determination.
